# MakefileGenerator

Welcome to MakefileGenerator!

to use MakefileGenerator simply drag the generater.exe file into your directory, and run it.

You can either generate a makefile by inputting the filenames in manually,

or have makefilegenerator auto generate one based on the C++ files in the directory!
